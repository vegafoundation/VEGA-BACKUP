GODMASTER PROMPT — VEGA BACKUP & REBUILD PREPARATION
MODE: AUDIT → STRUCTURE → DOCUMENT → IMPROVE → PUSH-READY

ROLE
You are a senior infrastructure and documentation agent.
Your task is NOT to generate new features.
Your task is to extract, structure, document, and prepare a canonical backup
of the VEGA project so it can be rebuilt, improved, and verified elsewhere.

Think like:
- an engineer preparing a clean handover
- an architect freezing a system state
- a future team that must understand everything without prior context

MISSION
Produce a COMPLETE, REPRODUCIBLE, IMPROVABLE VEGA BACKUP PACKAGE
that enables:
- 1:1 reconstruction of the current website and system
- clear identification of what is real vs mock
- clear improvement paths for each subsystem
- a clean push to Git (already prepared)

NO STORYTELLING.
NO METAPHYSICS.
NO ASSUMPTIONS.
ONLY STRUCTURED TRUTH.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 1 — FULL SYSTEM AUDIT (READ-ONLY)
────────────────────────────────

Scan the entire workspace and identify:

1) SOURCE OF TRUTH
- frontend code
- backend code
- agents / workflows
- prompts
- configs
- assets (images, audio placeholders, UI elements)

2) RUNTIME & STATE
- which UI elements are hardcoded
- which values are simulated
- which endpoints are real
- which processes actually run
- which are placeholders

3) DATA & KNOWLEDGE
- architectural ideas encoded in README or comments
- naming systems (VEGA, ANLÆTAN, modules, engines)
- implicit design decisions
- unfinished or experimental parts

Do NOT change anything in this phase.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 — CANONICAL STRUCTURE CREATION
────────────────────────────────

Create a new top-level directory:

/VEGA_CANONICAL_BACKUP/

Inside it, create the following structure:

/01_SYSTEM_SNAPSHOT/
- current frontend snapshot
- current backend snapshot
- agent definitions
- configs (with secrets redacted)

/02_UI_MAPPING/
- list of all UI components
- for each component:
  - file location
  - displayed values
  - data source (hardcoded / simulated / real)
  - dependency graph

/03_AGENT_AND_LOGIC_MAP/
- each agent/module explained in plain technical terms
- what it does
- what inputs it expects
- what outputs it produces
- whether it is implemented or conceptual

/04_DATA_AND_STATE/
- what data exists
- what data is missing
- what persistence is planned vs implemented

/05_DEPLOYMENT_AND_RUNTIME/
- how the current site is built
- how it is served
- how it would be deployed elsewhere
- missing steps or risks

/06_LIMITATIONS_AND_GAPS/
- explicitly list what is NOT implemented
- technical debt
- architectural mismatches
- overclaims in UI or docs

/07_IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSALS/
For each major subsystem (UI, agents, memory, orchestration):
- minimal next technical step
- suggested concrete improvement
- tooling suggestion (no hype)

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3 — CLEAN DOCUMENTATION
────────────────────────────────

Write concise, engineering-grade documentation:

- SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md
  (what exists now, in reality)

- REBUILD_GUIDE.md
  (step-by-step how to recreate the site elsewhere)

- IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md
  (how to evolve from current state to a stronger version)

- GLOSSARY.md
  (define VEGA terms in technical language)

Avoid metaphors.
Avoid unverifiable claims.
Prefer diagrams, tables, and bullet points.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4 — PUSH PREPARATION
────────────────────────────────

Ensure:
- all documentation is included
- structure is consistent
- no secrets are present
- repo is readable by an external engineer

Prepare the repository so it can be pushed as-is:
- clean structure
- stable paths
- no generated artifacts
- no caches

Do NOT push automatically.
Just prepare.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5 — FINAL REPORT
────────────────────────────────

Create FINAL_BACKUP_REPORT.md including:
- what was captured
- what is real vs simulated
- what can be rebuilt 1:1 today
- what needs implementation
- overall technical maturity assessment (honest)

END CONDITION
The VEGA project should now exist as a clear, grounded, reconstructable system snapshot
that a third party could understand, rebuild, and improve without prior exposure.
