VEGA BACKUP PUSH — FINALIZATION PROMPT (Replit Agent)

ROLE
You are an infra+docs agent. Your job is to make the VEGA-BACKUP repo a canonical, rebuildable snapshot.
Do not invent features. Do not add new engines. Do not write mythology.
Make the repo truthful, reproducible, and easy to rebuild elsewhere.

TARGET REPO
This workspace is already pushed to GitHub (vegafoundation/VEGA-BACKUP).
We will prepare one final “canonical backup push” commit that improves documentation + rebuild fidelity.

GOALS
A) Ensure “1:1 rebuild” is possible with clear commands.
B) Mark what is REAL vs MOCK in UI and logic.
C) Produce an “Implementation Gap Map” and “Improvement Proposals”.
D) Ensure no secrets are present.
E) Keep repo size lean and exportable.

PHASE 1 — AUDIT (READ-ONLY)
1. Locate frontend entrypoints (pages/components) and backend entrypoints (server/app/routes).
2. Identify UI fields that display:
   - ACTIVE/READY badges
   - coherence/resonance scores
   - agent lists
   For each, determine if values are:
   - HARDCODED
   - SIMULATED (mock json)
   - REAL (computed or fetched from backend)
3. Identify all environment variables needed (from code + docs). Confirm .env.example matches.
4. Identify any large/bloat directories (node_modules, archives, build outputs, caches) and ensure .gitignore covers them.

PHASE 2 — CANONICAL DOCS
Create or update these files at repo root:

1) README.md (SHORT + TRUTHFUL)
Include:
- What VEGA-BACKUP is
- How to run locally (3 commands)
- “Reality Map” section:
  - Real components (list)
  - Mock/simulated components (list)
- Where canonical docs live (VEGA_CANONICAL_BACKUP/)

2) REBUILD_GUIDE.md
Step-by-step:
- prerequisites
- install
- run dev
- build
- deploy notes
- common failures & fixes

3) REALITY_MAP.md
A table:
- UI element
- file path
- data source (hardcoded/simulated/real)
- how to make it real (one-line suggestion)

4) IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md
Prioritized:
- P0: one real metric (embedding similarity) wired end-to-end
- P1: persistent memory (vector store)
- P2: multi-agent coordination
Keep it grounded and implementable.

PHASE 3 — SAFETY / SECRETS
1. Scan for secrets:
- API keys
- tokens
- private URLs
If found, redact and move to .env.example placeholder.
2. Confirm no secrets are committed.

PHASE 4 — REPO HYGIENE
1. Ensure .gitignore is correct for:
- node_modules
- dist/build
- .cache
- logs
- archives
2. Ensure “download as zip” stays small and clean.

PHASE 5 — FINAL COMMIT PREP
1. Summarize changes in FINAL_BACKUP_REPORT.md (append a new “Repo Finalization” section).
2. Prepare ONE clean commit with message:
   "Canonical backup: rebuild guide + reality map + hygiene"

OUTPUT REQUIRED
Before finishing, print:
- a list of files you created/updated
- the exact local rebuild commands
- a compact “Real vs Mock” bullet list
- any remaining risks
