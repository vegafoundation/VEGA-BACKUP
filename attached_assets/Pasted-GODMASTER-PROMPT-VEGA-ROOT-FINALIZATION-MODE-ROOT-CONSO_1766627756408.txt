GODMASTER PROMPT — VEGA ROOT FINALIZATION
MODE: ROOT → CONSOLIDATE → MIRROR → PUSH

ROLE
You are the final consolidation agent.
Your task is to prepare the VEGA system for ROOT usage:
a clean, truthful, minimal, canonical state
from which everything else can grow.

This is the LAST preparation run.
No new features.
No redesign.
No ideology.
Only structure, truth, and continuity.

ROOT PRINCIPLE
ROOT is the single source of truth.
ROOT means:
- one canonical structure
- one readable state
- one reproducible base
Everything else can branch later.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 1 — ROOT AUDIT (READ-ONLY)
────────────────────────────────

Scan the entire workspace and identify:

- what is essential for rebuilding VEGA
- what is documentation vs code
- what is mock vs real
- what is experimental vs stable

Mark mentally, do not delete yet.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 2 — ROOT STRUCTURE CREATION
────────────────────────────────

Create a top-level directory:

/ROOT/

Inside /ROOT/, create ONLY these folders:

/ROOT/system/
- canonical frontend snapshot
- canonical backend snapshot
- agents (as-is, documented)

/ROOT/docs/
- system overview
- rebuild guide
- reality map (real vs mock)
- glossary (technical, not poetic)

/ROOT/state/
- VTC snapshot (files only, no runtime)
- current known states / placeholders

/ROOT/meta/
- decisions made
- limitations
- known gaps
- next possible directions (short)

/ROOT/exports/
- instructions for export as ZIP
- instructions for Git continuation

Move or COPY (do not invent) existing material into this structure.
Prefer COPY over MOVE if unsure.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 3 — CLEANING (SAFE ONLY)
────────────────────────────────

Remove ONLY:
- duplicated archives
- temporary files
- caches
- build artifacts
- anything already represented inside /ROOT/

Do NOT touch source logic unless it is clearly redundant.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 4 — ROOT DOCUMENTATION
────────────────────────────────

Create these files inside /ROOT/docs/:

1) ROOT_README.md
Explain:
- what ROOT is
- what it contains
- how it should be used
- how NOT to misuse it

2) ROOT_REBUILD.md
Step-by-step:
- prerequisites
- install
- run
- deploy
- verify

3) ROOT_REALITY_MAP.md
Table:
- component
- path
- status (real / mock / planned)
- notes

Tone: engineering calm. No metaphors.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 5 — FINAL PUSH PREPARATION
────────────────────────────────

Ensure:
- ROOT is self-contained
- no secrets are present
- structure is readable without context
- size is minimal and exportable

Prepare for a FINAL push:
- clean
- deterministic
- boring (this is good)

Do NOT push automatically.
Just prepare the state.

────────────────────────────────
PHASE 6 — FINAL REPORT
────────────────────────────────

Create /ROOT/FINAL_ROOT_REPORT.md with:

- what ROOT now represents
- what is preserved
- what is intentionally left out
- how future work should branch from ROOT

End with a clear sentence:
"ROOT is stable. Further work should branch, not overwrite."

END CONDITION
The VEGA system must now exist as a ROOT state:
small, honest, rebuildable, and calm.
